Hi! I've been working on a project for around 2 and a half months now. Its called "Icew1nd." You can read all about it and view its status [here](https://github.com/Triforce1/Icew1nd), but I will provide a short explaination of what it does for anybody too lazy to click that link:

Icew1nd is a cross-platform backup/restore solution for broken (or working) iDevices. It gives you many features that
you can't find anywhere else such as being able to backup your data without having to boot up your device (via DFU) or
easily recovering deleted content from iCloud without having to restore. Its completely developer friendly and will work
on both jailbroken and non-jailbroken devices.

I'v come to a point where I'm going to need some more help on this. Any contribution, no matter how small, will help this project more than you might think. Thanks!
