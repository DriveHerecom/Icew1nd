Hi! I've been working on a project for around 2 and a half months now. Its called "Icew1nd." You can read all about it and view its status [here](https://github.com/Triforce1/Icew1nd), but I will provide a short explaination of what it does for anybody too lazy to click that link:

Icew1nd is a cross-platform backup/restore solution for broken (or working) iDevices. It gives you many features that you can't find anywhere else such as being able to backup your data without having to boot up your device (via DFU) or easily recovering deleted content from iCloud without having to restore. Its completely developer  friendly and will work on both jailbroken and non-jailbroken devices.  

I still need these people:
